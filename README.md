# WordleClone
#
# This terminal-based Wordle clone was written in Python, making use of the Rich library to format much of the terminal output.
#
# Using the Project Gutenberg release of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, the program randomly selects a list of five-letter words from The Bard's oeuvre. This list is narrowed down to a single word, which the user must solve within six guesses. Hopefully you know your Timon from your Titus.
#
# Some ideas for future development:

#    Develop a dedicated user/web interface outside of the terminal (no hard feelings, Rich)
#    Implement validation to ensure only valid words are accepted as guesses
#    Include functionality for keeping track of user statistics, e.g. keep track of their score
