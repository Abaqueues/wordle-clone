# WordleClone


## Overview
This terminal-based Wordle clone was written in Python, making use of the Rich library to format much of the terminal output.

Using the Project Gutenberg release of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, the program randomly selects a list of five-letter words from The Bard's oeuvre. This list is narrowed down to a single word, which the user must solve within six guesses. Hopefully you know your Timon from your Titus.

## Further Development
Some ideas for future development:

- Develop a dedicated user/web interface outside of the terminal (no hard feelings, Rich)
- Implement validation to ensure only valid words are accepted as guesses
- Include functionality for keeping track of user statistics, e.g. keep track of their score
